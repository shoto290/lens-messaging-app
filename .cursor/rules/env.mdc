# Environment Variables Guide

Environment variables are managed in [src/env.ts](mdc:src/env.ts) using `@t3-oss/env-core` and `zod` for validation. Only variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the client.

- Add new variables to the `client` and `runtimeEnv` sections in [env.ts](mdc:src/env.ts).
- Use `zod` schemas to validate variable types and presence.
- Access variables via the exported `env` object.

Refer to [env.ts](mdc:src/env.ts) for the current list of environment variables and their usage.
