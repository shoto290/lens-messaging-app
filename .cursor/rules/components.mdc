# Components Directory Guide

The [src/components/](mdc:src/components/) directory contains reusable UI and feature components. Subdirectories group related components (e.g., [ui/](mdc:src/components/ui/), [sidebar/](mdc:src/components/sidebar/)).

- Components should be small, focused, and follow the single responsibility principle.
- Use meaningful, descriptive names for components and props.
- Prefer composition over inheritance for building complex UIs.
- UI primitives (buttons, inputs, etc.) are in [ui/](mdc:src/components/ui/).
- Feature components (e.g., [data-table.tsx](mdc:src/components/data-table.tsx)) should encapsulate their logic and expose clear interfaces.

Refer to the components directory for available building blocks and patterns.
