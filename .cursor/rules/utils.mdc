# Utilities Guide

The [src/lib/](mdc:src/lib/) directory contains utility functions and helpers (e.g., [utils.ts](mdc:src/lib/utils.ts)).

- Utility functions should be pure, reusable, and have clear, descriptive names.
- Avoid duplicating logic; add new utilities here if they are used in multiple places.
- Keep utility files small and focused by domain or purpose.

Refer to the lib directory for available helpers and abstractions.
