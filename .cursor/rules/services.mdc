# Services Layer Guide

The [src/services/](mdc:src/services/) directory contains modules responsible for API communication and business logic. Each service file (e.g., [user-service.ts](mdc:src/services/user-service.ts)) provides functions for interacting with backend endpoints, abstracting HTTP details from the rest of the app.

- Use service functions for all API calls to ensure consistency and error handling.
- Service files should not contain UI logic.
- Types for service responses are defined in corresponding `.types.ts` files.

Refer to the service files for available API methods and their usage.
