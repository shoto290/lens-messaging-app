# Clean Code Guidelines

All code contributions must follow the Clean Code Guidelines:

- Use named constants instead of magic numbers; keep them at the top or in a constants file.
- Choose meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes that reveal intent.
- Write self-documenting code; use comments only to explain why, not what.
- Ensure each function has a single responsibility and is small and focused.
- Avoid code duplication by extracting reusable logic (DRY principle).
- Organize code in a logical, hierarchical structure with consistent naming.
- Encapsulate implementation details and expose clear interfaces.
- Continuously refactor and address technical debt.
- Write and maintain readable, comprehensive tests, including edge cases.
- Use version control best practices: clear commit messages, small commits, and meaningful branch names.

Refer to these guidelines for all code reviews and new development.
