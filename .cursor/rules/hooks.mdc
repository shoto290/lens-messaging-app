# Custom Hooks Guide

The [src/hooks/](mdc:src/hooks/) directory contains custom React hooks for encapsulating reusable logic (e.g., [use-mobile.ts](mdc:src/hooks/use-mobile.ts)).

- Hooks should be named with the `use` prefix and describe their purpose clearly.
- Each hook should do one thing and return a clear, documented interface.
- Avoid side effects in hooks unless necessary; document any non-obvious behavior.
- Group related hooks in subdirectories for clarity.

Refer to the hooks directory for available custom logic and usage patterns.
